            The state of Georgia has tons of stunning wildlife from reptilians like the Green Anoles and American Toads, 
            to the Appalachian Cottontail and White-tailed deer. 
            When hiking it is important to know what to do when when coming across dangerous animals like Rattlesnakes and Alligators, 
            use common sense and keep your distance and leave them be, if you don’t provoke them, 
            they’ll leave you alone. All wildlife in Georgia has its own part in taking care of the biodiverse ecosystem, 
            and it’s important to respect each animal as such.

            <p>
                Alligators are fascinating creatures and important to the ecosystem of Georgia. 
                They help maintain the population for certain animals and they help shape and modify habitats. 
                Gators can be found in the wet environments of Georgia like marshes, swamps, slow moving rivers, and lakes. 
                When in an area or hiking on a trail with the possibility of alligators, be on the watch, use common sense, give them the respect they deserve and leave them be.

        <h1>Snakes</h1>
        <p>
            Snakes are also important to the Georgia ecosystem.
            They hunt rats and mice, and other animals that are referred to as pests. 
            Some snakes can even be useful as bioindicators for indicating pollutants in wet ecosystems.
            The state of Georgia is also amongst the highest states with snake biodiversity at 47 different species of snakes, and
            out of all 47 species of snakes, only 6 are venomous.
            It's important to learn how to identify each venomous snake in Georgia in case you encounter them.
