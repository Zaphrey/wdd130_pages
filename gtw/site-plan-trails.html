            The main topic for the main page of "Georgia Trails & Wildlife" talks about a select variety of trails. Georgia T&W aims to teach one another about some of the trails in the state of Georgia. From stunning geography to outstanding animals to all the plants and environments, Georgia is a beautiful place in the United States to explore. There are all kinds of trails with their own difficulties, ranging from short and easy hikes for grandparents to take their grandchildren on to visitors looking to explore the state. To longer and more challenging hikes for folks that are wanting to go the extra mile. I’ve gone hiking with my granddad before, but the most memorable hike I’ve had with him was this trail he took me on near Columbus, Georgia, when I was only 7 years old. I remember being amazed at all of the scenery, especially when we arrived at a waterfall along the trail. I still remember that trail, and I want to help others experience the same feeling I had that day. It was fun, and it made me fall in love with all the natural beauty that can still be found here today.<br>
            
            The first subpage's main topic aims to teach others about some of the wildlife that can be found within the state of Georgia. I would like to expand it a little more to include some other animals, but mainly for now I want to teach anyone who visits Georgia how to identify some of the more dangerous predators that can be found in Georgia, like rattlesnakes and alligators, and what environments they mostly reside in. My goal for this subpage is to at least showcase some text on how to identify all six species of venomous snakes in Georgia and hopefully have them educate others who aren’t aware of how to identify them. The subpage will also talk about how to avoid getting into dangerous scenarios with these animals, like keeping your distance and being aware of your surroundings, and that dangerous predators will only attack you in self-defense if you provoke them.<br>

            The second subpage will mention some of the important supplies that you should always bring on a hike, like a first aid kit or some sun screen and bug spray. Ticks can be found in Georgia, so it’s important to carry the proper supplies to get them off of you and clean up the area where the tick bit you. Water is also extremely important while hiking in Georgia. It gets really hot during the summer, and depending on the type of trail you’re hiking on, it can get really humid too, which makes you feel even hotter. A few years ago, when me and my family went to Six Flags, we could only afford two cups and could only get refills every so often due to how expensive the concessions are there. I remember not feeling well more and more throughout the day because I wasn’t able to keep myself hydrated for the heat properly. And because of that, I just couldn’t enjoy rides anymore, so I sat down for the rest of the day until we were ready to leave.<br>

            Why will people like to come to my site? I think the site could be useful to a variety of people looking for one type of content on the page, like snake identification or hiking supplies, or to other people sticking around the whole site trying to find a new hiking trail that fits their needs.<br>

            What questions will visitors expect your site to answer for them? One question a visitor could have when visiting the site is learning what kinds of wildlife we have here in Georgia, or another question could be trying to figure out what to pack for a hike.<br>

      <h3>Wildlife</h3>
      <p>
        The state of Georgia has tons of stunning wildlife from reptilians like the Green Anoles and American Toads, to the Appalachian Cottontail and White-tailed deer. When hiking it is important to know what to do when when coming across dangerous animals like Rattlesnakes and Alligators, use common sense and keep your distance and leave them be, if you don’t provoke them, they’ll leave you alone. All wildlife in Georgia has its own part in taking care of the biodiverse ecosystem, and it’s important to respect each animal as such.

      <h3>Supplies</h3>
      <p>
        Bringing the right hiking supplies is very important when going on a hiking trip. Make sure you plan out your trip to the T and have the proper supplies for the trail you’ve chosen. If it’s a sunny trail you may want to bring sunscreen or a sun hat. If the area is more wooded, bring some bug spray. Always be prepared and be aware of where you are going.
