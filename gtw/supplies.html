            Bringing the right hiking supplies is very important when going on a hiking trip. 
            Make sure you plan out your trip to the smallest detail and have the proper supplies for the trail you’ve chosen. 
            For example, if it’s a sunny trail you may want to bring sunscreen or a sun hat. 
            If the area is more wooded, bring some bug spray. 
            Always be prepared and be aware of where you are going.
