            Georgia Trails & Wildlife aims to teach one another about some of the trails in the state of Georgia. 
            From stunning geography to outstanding animals, to all the plants and environments, 
            Georgia is a beautiful place in the United States to explore. 
            Thereâ€™s all kinds of trails with their own difficulties ranging from short and easy 
            hikes for grandparents to take their grandchildren on, or visitors looking to explore the state. 
            To longer and more challenging hikes for folks that are wanting to go the extra mile.
